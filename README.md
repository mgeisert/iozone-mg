# _iozone-mg_
Mods to _iozone_ to fully support Cygwin and native Windows.

_Note that this is still a work in progress.  I've set the version to 3.472 simply
because the work is based on 3.471.  When the work is completed and offered to the
iozone project, it may become part of some other iozone version TBD._
